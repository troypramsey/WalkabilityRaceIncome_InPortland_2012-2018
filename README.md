Shared repo for UO project #1

### Our project is to look at the relationship between walkability index/score across three dimensions: pedestrian foot traffic, health, and socioeconomics. As we discover data, we will focus on a specific city and its neighborhoods.

- Specify and choose "health" metrics: Life expectancy, level of existing health conditions, Does some overall meta-health metric exist? from CDC data 

- Specify and choose "socioeconomics" metrics: Median age, Median income from IRS and Census

- find a city with good data, use that data to help define our terms

- data source ideas:

- Zillow walkability API
    - CDC API
    - Data.gov
    - cityoflakes Data MPLS
    - Data.world
    - LA city data
    - PDX
    - Healthcare.gov
